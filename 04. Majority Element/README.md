## Majority Element #Ô∏è‚É£

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ```n / 2``` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]
    Output: 3

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
    Output: 2


### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm üßÆ

It is used to find the majority element in an array, i.e., the element that appears more than half the time (if such an element exists). It operates in linear time ```O(n)``` and constant space ```O(1)```, making it very efficient.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Set a candidate element and a count to zero.
2. **Candidate Selection**:
   - Traverse through the array.
   - If count is zero, set the current element as the new candidate and set count to 1.
   - If the current element equals the candidate, increment count.
   - If the current element is different, decrement count.
3. **Validation**: After the first pass, the candidate may or may not be the majority element, so you should verify if it actually appears more than half the time.

This algorithm assumes that a majority element exists.
