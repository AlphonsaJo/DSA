The Pascal's Triangle problem typically involves generating Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where:

    The first and last values in each row are always 1.
    Each interior value is the sum of the two values directly above it from the previous row.
    
Example:
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
