**Q. What is Backtracking?**

Ans: <span style="color: black;">Backtracking</span> is a <span style="color: darkorange;"><strong>general algorithmic technique</strong></span> used to solve problems <span style="color: royalblue;">incrementally by trying out different possibilities</span> and <span style="color: red;">discarding those that don't meet the conditions</span>.

It is particularly useful for problems involving <span style="color: forestgreen;"><strong>searching through a set of possibilities</strong></span>, like puzzles, mazes, permutations, combinations, and constraint satisfaction problems.
