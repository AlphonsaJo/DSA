'''
Time Complexity:

    Building the Heap: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
    Heapify Operations: O(log n) per extraction, and since there are n elements, the total complexity for sorting is O(n log n).

Space Complexity: Heap sort has a space complexity of O(1), meaning it sorts the array in-place without requiring additional storage beyond the input array.

Stability: Heap sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it does not necessarily preserve the relative order of equal elements.
